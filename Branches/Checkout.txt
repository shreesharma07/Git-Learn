// Git Checkout //
/*
    -- "Checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity.
    -- "checkout" command operated upon three distint entities: files, commits and branches.
    -- "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of executing the `git checkout` command.
*/

/*
    -- Checking out branches is similar to checking out old commits,
    -- and files in that the working directory is updated to match the selected branch/revision;
    -- however, new changes are saved in the project history—that is, it’s not a read-only operation.
