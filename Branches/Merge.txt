// Git Merge //
-->  Merge is Git's way of putting forked history backed together again.
-->  The "Git Merge" command lets tyou take the independent lines of
    development created by "Git Branch" and integrate them into a single branch.

--> How It Works ?
    - Git Merge will combine multiple sequence of commits into one unified history.
    - In most frequent use cases, git merge used to combine two branches.
    - "Git Merge" takes two commit pointers usually the branch tips and will find a common base commit and,
       it will create a new "Merge Commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence. 

// Steps for Merging two Branches //
Step 1 : Add Changes
Step 2 : Commit Changes
Step 3 : Push the Changes
Step 4 : Move to the branch where you want to merge the current working branch.
Step 5 : Use Command -- ``git merge <branch_name>`` E.g. : ``git merge Feature``
Step 6 : You can delete the branch using "git branch -D <branch_name>" E.g. : ``git branch -D Feature``
