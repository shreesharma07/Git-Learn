    -- Commands for Branches
        ->  ``git branch`` - to list all branches.
        ->  ``git branch --list`` - synonymous for the above command.
        ->  ``git branch -d <branch_name>`` - Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation,
                          in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes. 
        ->  ``git branch -D <branch_name>`` - Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged
                         changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of
                         the commits associated with a particular line of development.
        ->  ``git branch -m <branch_name>`` - Rename the current branch to <branch>.
        ->  ``git branch -a`` - List all remote branches.
